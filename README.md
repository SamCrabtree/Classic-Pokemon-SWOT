# Classic Pokemon SWOT 

In the Original Red, Blue, and Yellow games, there were 15 pokemon types including Normal, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Ghost and Dragon. Each of these types has advantages, and disadvantages 

The Classic Pokemon SWOT program allows you to choose your dream original pokemon team and then maps out your teams Strengths, Weaknesses, Oppurtunities, and Threats so you as a pokemon trainer can balance your team to poke-nirvana on your way to beat Gary and the Elite Four! 


## Goals of this Program 

1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.	

2. Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into the app. 

- This is done by utilizing the Pokemon API.  

3. Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.

4. Utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file.
